# MVC-Template-Web-Dev
This is a template web-application (which strictly follows the MVC design pattern), which can be used and extended to build more complex web applications.

MVC supports decoupling which reduces dependencies between different components of the system. It separates the application logic into three parts.
Model: Contains the data and business logic, such as database access.
View: Displays information to the user, these are the HTML scripts.
Controller: Process user input, and routing the user to the correct page.

This template provides the basic structure of the MVC design pattern, and can thus be extended to build more complex web applications.
